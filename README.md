-In the "Work With" box paste this: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/github/updates-nightly/  
-Click the "Select All" button.  
-Click "Next"  
-Wait and ignore possible errors. Obviously, accept the terms and condictions.  
-It will ask you to reset ecilpse. Do that.  
-Now, once eclipse is open again, in the "quick access" box, over the coding window, type "git" and from the options select "git repositories"  
-It will open a new windows under your project viewer.  
-Now, minimize eclipse and open your forge folder.  
-In the forge folder, make sure you can see hiden files (files that start with "."). If you can't, follow the instrutions here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-vista  
-Select ALL the files, including hidden files and hit CTRL+X, or right click and select cut.  
-Create a new folder somewhere, name it something and hit CTRL+V or right click and select paste.  
-Now open eclipse again, right click the forge project and hit refresh. You will get an error. That is normal.  
-On the repositories view, hit "clone repository", select github, and type in "WizardryMod". Hit search and you should see a repository called "WizardryModTeam/WizardryMod" select that.  
-On the folder, and this is very important, browse to your now empty forge folder. Then, make sure the path is "/forge" and NOT "/forge/WizardryMod". If the path is wrong, just delete the "/WizardyMod"  
-Select finish (or next, dont remember now.)  
-Finally, copy everything back from the folder you created to your forge folder. Now go back to eclipse, right click on forge and click refresh. No error should pop up this time.  
-It is now set up.  
How to use:  
-Just code normaly. When you want to commit anything, right click "forge[master]" in your repositories and select commit. Tipe in the changes you made (Type the least possible) and hit commit and push.  
-You will now what to do. Make sure you remember your master password.  
-I'll give you more information latter on the chat.
